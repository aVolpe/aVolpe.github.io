* It's illegal in Paraguay to have a Cartel (group of tenders that cooperate to inflate the price)?
* The COVID-related process are only 95:

  * active: 8	
  * cancelled: 5	
  * complete: 95	
  * unsuccessful: 3	
* It's good to investigate cases of cartels in Paraguay to use as control

* A network approach - Johannes Wachs & János Kertész1
  * Our COVID data is too small
  * Maybe use the full dataset
  * We need a model to calculate the similarity between to biders (they connect two firms based on the similarity of their bidding behavior).
  * This model is only suggestive (the same as the entire portal)
  * There are other cartel types:

  > We also acknowledge that there are other cartel strategies in public contracting markets beside bid-rigging, for instance when firms agree to stay out of each others’ markets entirely.


* Predicting Public Procurement Irregularity: An Application of Neural Networks
  * DNN (deep neural network)
  * It's better that the alternatives
  * It's a early alarm system

* A variance screen for collusion
  * To detect collusion (carters)
  * use of the price level as a screen is limited to industries in which the competitive level is known
  * Easier method: identical bids
  * We contribute to this literature by proposing a screen based on the coefficient of variation. The screen is suggested by the observed differences following the collapse of a cartel, in which average weekly price level decreased by 16%, while the standard deviation of price increased by 263%.
  * We know far too little about how real cartels actually operate. Retrospective studies of cartel prosecutions, particularly when they result in the collapse of a cartel, allow researchers to compare a collusive regime to a competitive one to isolate the critical features of the conspiracy


* Assessing the potential for detecting collusion in Swedish public procurement
  * Second, it records bid prices not only for winners, but also for losing bidders which is a comparatively rare, but important practice for in-depth collusion detection analysis
  * central platform publishing all tender announcements which are regulated by national public procurement law
  * Type of anomalies:
   (i) withheld bids, (ii) non-competitive bidding, and (iii) joint bidding. 

* Machine learning with screens for detecting bid-rigging cartels
  * 584 tenders
  * The first step relies on our combination of machine learning and screening
  * The second step consists of scrutinizing tenders flagged as collusive by machine learning
* Network similarity and collusion
  * construction industry
  * The construction industry is known for being extremely com- plex and diverse, involving non-standard activities that are difficult to assess and monitor
  * How- ever, detection is usually the result of extensive media scrutiny, whistleblowing, or lengthy enforcement efforts to prosecute par- ticipants
  * after complaints were filed by competitors
  * Their finding emphasized the degree to which conspir- ators depend on secrecy and minimal contacts to avoid detection
  * firm’s ability to win a contract is driven by its market activ- ity
* Toolkit for detecting collusive bidding in public procurement 
  * While no one-size-fits-all approach exists in detecting collusion
